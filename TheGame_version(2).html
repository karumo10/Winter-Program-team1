			A Little Game
		</h1>
		<h4>
			This is a little game redesigned and implemented by a group of students
		<h4>
		<h2>
			Now here are a few tips about how to play the game
		</h2>
			<h3><ul>
				<li>The character that you are controlling is represented as a (ball). You can control it via these keys: </li>
				<ul>
					<li>() for upper left</li>
					<li>() for upper right</li>
					<li>() for left</li>
					<li>() for right</li>
					<li>() for lower left</li>
					<li>() for lower right</li>
				</ul>
				<li>What you are gonna do is to steal the rectangle and safely return to where you start</li>
				<li>The enemies armed with guns are represented as a (balls with two covers). They will kill the invader immediately when the invader(you) comes into their visions! You should never be seen by them!</li>
				<li>The enemies armed with knives are represented as (balls with one cover). They will run to catch the invader! You should never be caught up by them!</li>
			</ul></h3>
		<br>
		<h2> Please note that: </h2>
			<h3><ul>
				<li>The enemies stay where they are until they turn around and see you! The gun get you killed immediately while those with knives will chase you. Even if you disappear they will still try to get to <h3>where you were!</h3>before they return to the positions that they took initially</li><br>
				<li>Try to make good use of those with knives since they help you hide from the guns.</li>
			</ul></h3>
